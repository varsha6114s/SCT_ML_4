# Hand Gesture Recognition Model
A deep learning model for real-time hand gesture recognition using computer vision. This model can detect and classify various hand gestures, making it suitable for human-computer interaction applications.
Features

# Real-time hand gesture recognition
Support for 10 common gestures (thumbs up, peace, palm, etc.)
Pre-trained on a diverse dataset of 50,000+ hand gestures
Average inference time of 20ms on CPU
95% accuracy on validation set
Platform-independent implementation

# Requirements
The following packages are required to run the model:

Python 3.8 or higher
TensorFlow 2.5.0 or higher
OpenCV Python 4.5.0 or higher
NumPy 1.19.0 or higher
MediaPipe 0.8.9 or higher

# Installation
The installation process consists of three main steps:

# Cloning the repository from GitHub
Setting up a virtual environment (recommended)
Installing the required dependencies

# Real-time webcam detection for continuous gesture recognition
Single image prediction for static gesture analysis

# Model Architecture
The model utilizes a modified MobileNetV2 architecture with the following specifications:

# Input size: 224x224x3
Output: 10 gesture classes
Custom attention layers for better spatial feature extraction
Dropout layers for preventing overfitting

# Training Process
The training process requires:

# A structured dataset with labeled gesture images
GPU acceleration recommended for faster training
Customizable hyperparameters for optimization

Required dataset structure:

Separate folders for each gesture class
Minimum 1000 images per gesture
Consistent image resolution
Varied lighting conditions and backgrounds
